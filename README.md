Project Euler with C

The files in this repo are my solutions to various problems in Project Euler

The Python and Java repositories have much more code to look at.

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant
and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
